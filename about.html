      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Our flower shop was founded in 1999 by two passionate florists who
        shared a love of flowers and a commitment to providing the highest
        quality floral arrangements. Over the years, we have grown into one of
        the most respected flower shops in the city, and we are proud to offer a
        wide variety of floral arrangements for all occasions.
